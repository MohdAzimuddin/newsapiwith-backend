## How It Works

### News Fetching:
- The app uses the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch news articles based on a query. The default query is set to **"India"**, but users can search for specific topics such as **Technology**, **Finance**, or **Sports**.
- News articles are displayed in cards containing an image, title, source, date, and description.
- Clicking on a news card opens the full article in a new tab.

### Navigation:
- The navigation menu at the top allows users to select different news categories.
- The selected category is highlighted, and the corresponding articles are displayed.

### Scroll-Up Button:
- When the user scrolls down the page, a **scroll-up button** appears in the bottom-right corner.
- Clicking this button scrolls the page smoothly back to the top.

### Responsiveness:
- The app is responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size. The number of columns in the news card grid reduces on smaller screens, ensuring a clean and usable interface on mobile devices.
